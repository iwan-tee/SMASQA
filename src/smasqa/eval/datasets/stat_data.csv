Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the transformed ""importance.score"" column.";metabolome.db;hard;is_normal: 0.0;The Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to check if the 'importance.score' column follows a normal distribution. The resulting p-value was **0.0**, which is less than the threshold of 0.05, indicating that the distribution is not normal. After applying a log transformation to the 'importance.score' column, the resulting transformed data was closer to normal. The mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed 'importance.score' column were calculated accordingly.;The Shapiro-Wilk test determined that the 'importance.score' column has a p-value of 0.05, which shows borderline evidence to reject normality. A log transformation was applied to marginally adjust the distribution. However, the p-value suggests that the data is still approximately normal after the transformation.;The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed a p-value greater than 0.05, which indicates that the 'importance.score' column follows a normal distribution. Therefore, no log transformation was needed, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated directly using the original scores.;The Shapiro-Wilk test was utilized to determine normality for the 'importance.duration' column, rather than the 'importance.score'. The p-value of 0.0 was derived for 'importance.duration', and a log transformation was applied incorrectly to this column instead of 'importance.score'.
